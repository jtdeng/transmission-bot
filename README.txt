Introduction
============
python-transmission-bot is an XMPP client which works as a proxy between 
transmission daemon and your XMPP enabled client such as GTalk, so that 
you can control your transmission bit-torrent server using any XMPP client. 
A typical use case is that you want to control your transmission daemon 
running on your DD-WRT router but you can not access your router from internet.

Functionality
=============
1. list all downloads with status
2. add a new download
3. start/pause/stop one or all downloads
4. delete one or all downloads (delete torrent or delete files on disk)
